Degrees of Freedom (DOF): 4–6 DOF (depending on configuration).

Segments:

Base Rotation: Provides 360° rotation using a NEMA 17 stepper or high-torque servo.
Shoulder Joint: Actuated using a NEMA 17 stepper with a 5:1 gear reduction, allowing smooth lifting and positioning.
Elbow Joint: Controlled by an NEMA 17, providing stable controlled movement within a physical range of -30° to +60° from horizontal.
Wrist Joint: MG996R servo, and NEMA 17 capable of up to 360° rotation or constrained movement for orientation control.
Gripper: Servo-powered parallel for object holding.
