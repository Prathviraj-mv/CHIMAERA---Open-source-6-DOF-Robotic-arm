# CHIMAERA---Open-source-6-DOF-Robotic-arm

Multi-joint articulated manipulator designed for precision movement and small-scale automation, experimentation, and learning advanced control.

Degrees of Freedom (DOF): 6 DOF 

Segments:

Base Rotation: Provides 360째 rotation using a NEMA 17 stepper or high-torque servo.
Shoulder Joint: Actuated using a NEMA 17 stepper with a 5:1 gear reduction, allowing smooth lifting and positioning.
Elbow Joint: Controlled by an NEMA 17, providing stable controlled movement within a physical range of -30째 to +60째 from horizontal.
Wrist Joint: MG996R servo, and NEMA 17 capable of up to 360째 rotation or constrained movement for orientation control.
Gripper: Servo-powered parallel for object holding.
